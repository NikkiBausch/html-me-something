      <id="Additional-Info">Nikki originally intended to be a translator of German and Czech texts. Her past projects in translation include selected texts of German-Czech Jewish authors of the early 20th century, whose works have fallen into obscurity or out of publication, music journal articles and interviews, and tourism and marketing texts (for Czech). She still takes on projects occasionally.
      She also has an ongoing photo documentation project of temporary graves in cemeteries in Austria, Germany, and Czechia (and eventually elsewhere in Central Europe) On occasion, she also photographs old cemeteries found in corn fields in the Midwestern United States. </id>
